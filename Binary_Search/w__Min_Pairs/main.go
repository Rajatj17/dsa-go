// It says you are given 2 non-empty is OK.

// You need to find a pair of numbers, one from each array so you need to pick a number from this array,

// a number from this array whose absolute difference is minimum.

// So we need to find such a pair a,b such

// That's that A minus B.

// This absolute value is going to be minimal.

// Now, there are multiple ways to solve this problem.

// For example, you can do a brute force approach very easily.
