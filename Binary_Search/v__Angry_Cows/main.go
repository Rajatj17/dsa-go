// Okay, so the question is, there is a long wire
// along a straight line to the long straight line, which contains n bird nests at different positions,
// x1 x2 up to xn there are multiple different positions.
// Let's say this is x1, x2 is x3 and up top to xn and each of these positions contain a nest against
// a bird can sit inside the nest.
// There is a nest at every location.
// There are B number of birds and it is given that B is less than equal doing OK.
// And also the birds will become angry towards each other if you put them closer or if you put them inside
// the same nest.
// OK.
// So if you put two birds inside the same nest, they will become angry.
// So to put the birds from hurting each other, you want to assign birds to nests.
// That's the minimum distance between two of them is as large as possible.
// OK, so you want to put birds in such a manner so that the minimum distances maximized.

// Input
// N = 5 Nests
// B = 3 Birds
// Nests = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]

// Output: 3
