// LCA
// Given a Binary Search Tree and values of two nodes that lie inside the tree, find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).

// Let T be a rooted tree. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

// You may assume that both the values exist in the tree and are unique.

// For example - LCA of Node(9) and Node(25) is 12.
// 12 is closes to both 9 and 25, and in ancestor of both the nodes.

// More examples

// LCA of Node(9) and Node(3) is 5.

// LCA of Node(9) and Node(12) is 12
