  Question:
	 	Arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
		Minimum Difference between Subet possible in the set

	Concept

	1. Find out the values which are possible in the array to be considered as minimum subset sum
	2. Make use of formula: Range - 2S1 = Mininum
	3. Find out all the possible values using SubsetSum Partition Problem
	4. Now you just need to itere over everything & find minimum value in that by putting the value inside
	   Range - 2S1 formula
	5. Wrong here

**/

func MinimumSubetSum(arr []int) {
	// Figure out all the possible minimum values

	// Call SubsetSum

	// Now iterave over the values present in last row and find	 minimum
}
